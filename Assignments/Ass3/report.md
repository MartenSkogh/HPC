# HPC Assignemt 3 - OpenMP

## Introduction
The goal of this assignment was to implement a program that reads a number of positions in space from a file, calculates all the distances between points, counts how many times each distance occurs and write out the distance and the number of occurrences to stdout. The program shall also be parallelized using OpenMP and be fast enough to pass some requirements.
